# metacave
## One cave survey data format to rule them all

(In progress!)

Metacave is a JSON cave survey data format.  That means it's:
* Way easier to parse and interpret than any other formats out there
* More human-readable and futureproof
* Extensible!
  * You can add all the metadata you want to any shot, station, trip, or cave,
    and give it a nice structure
  * You can embed program-specific features in it, without ruining another
    program's ability to load the base survey data
* Easy to store in MongoDB

                                            we'll cover how to handle that below

                                            a different cave, for connections.  Stations
                                            in different caves can have the same name, but
                                            will be considered distinct.

                                            Default unit: "angleUnit"

            "nsew": [3, 2, 4, [6, "in"]]    Optional distances - the NSEWs at this
                                            station. They will also be associated with
                                            the surrounding shots.

                                            (Note that you can also put unit overrides in
